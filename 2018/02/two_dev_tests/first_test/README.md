1. string_parse(): Look at the text in the test. Parse the passed in text and return a list of tuples of the likes and dislikes as seen in the test. Note that I don't want the top entry since that is a header.

1. get_dynamic_classes(): For a given list of names, return a list of classes created dynamically that are named the same as the names passed in (assume names will always be valid class names).
