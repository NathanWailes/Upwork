# Instructions for using the solution
- The Python version used while developing the solution is `3.5.2`.
- You should add your Google Geocoding API key to settings.ini to get it to work. You can get one [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start#get-a-key).
- Just a heads up: I added the header "id, name, address, latitude, longitude" to the top of the CSV file for ease of use.
- The `requirements.txt` contains the list of packages you need to install to run the program. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
from your command line to install them.

## Running the server
1. Run `python api.py` from the command line to run the server.

## Running the tests
1. Run `python tests.py` from the command line.
