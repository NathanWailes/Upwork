#### Notes from Nathan:

- 99% of the code here isn't mine. I just changed a few lines.
- The "people" program was working fine. The "events" program was the one crashing. I fixed
it by switching it to use urllib.urlretrieve(), which I learned about by just doing a
Google search and seeing an answer on Stack Overflow.
- You can see what I did by comparing the "raw_events...py" and "raw_events...fixed.py" files.
