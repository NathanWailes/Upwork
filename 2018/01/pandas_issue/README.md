#### Notes from Nathan:

- 99% of the code in the "pandas_solution.py" is not mine. I just switched two lines to use `combine_first()`
after getting some advice on Stack Overflow about how to achieve the desired behavior.
- I spent *way* too long coming up with a non-pandas solution. I should've posted the question immediately on Stack
Overflow because I got a quick pandas answer within 5-10 minutes.
