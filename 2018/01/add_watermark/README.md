# Notes from Nathan:

- The task here was to develop a custom script for adding watermarks to photos used in real estate listings.
- For this project the client submitted pseudocode of how they wanted it to work, so I tried to make
my implementation match that pseudocode as closely as possible, so it'd be easier for him to
understand how it worked. I also used his comments to comment the actual code.
