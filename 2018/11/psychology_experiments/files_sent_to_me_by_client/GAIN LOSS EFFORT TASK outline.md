**Baseline Finger tapping:**

- &quot;Ready&quot; &quot;Set&quot; &quot;Go&quot; should appear on the screen.
- Count the number of times participants press the space for 30 seconds. This should be stored in the data file.
- When 30 seconds are over move on to the next screen.

**MAXGAIN trials:**

**Instr4:**

&quot;In this part of the game you can earn money by pressing on the space bar on the keyboard in front of you. How much money you earn depends on many times you press the space bar. A message on the screen will tell you how much money you earned.

There are 10 trials and you can earn 10 cents per trial if you press the space bar enough times.

Your task is to try and earn as much money as you can. You may stop at any time. If you do not click on the space bar for 15 seconds the game will end.
