## Notes from Nathan

I used the PsychoPy desktop GUI to complete this assignment, so I was debating not including the project in this repo, but 
there were many instances of me needing to use my knowledge of Python to understand why the GUI wasn't doing what I 
wanted it to do (PsychoPy is written in Python, experiments are compiled to Python files, and the GUI uses Python syntax
when referring to variables and when custom behavior is required.)

In any case, I think this project is a good example of me learning to use a new tool to complete an assignment.

Altogether it took about ten hours for me to complete the two experiments, including time spent making adjustments asked
for by the client.
